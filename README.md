## CardioVista - Pioneering Precision in Heart Health

## THEME

## CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCES AND TECH APPLICATIONS IN CARDIOVASCULAR THORACIC SURGERY

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To build a digital tool (app or website) to help heart surgeons/cardiologists plan wellness plans/preventive cardiac care basis health parameters like age, working hours, BMI/number of steps/sleep hour. The app should help patients stay fit and warn them of any red flags basis integration of smart watches. For making the process of cardiac surgery planning easier and improving patient outcomes develop a ML based prediction technique using supervised machine learning basis health parameters of patients

## What and Why solve this problem?
Cardiovascular disease remains a major healthcare burden. Our project presents a necessary solution: a digital tool, in the form of an website, to empower cardiac professionals. This tool uses essential health metrics like age, BMI, and real-time smartwatch data to create personalized wellness plans for patients. This solution addresses the crucial need for early intervention and preventative measures. The core of our project is a machine learning prediction model(SVM and Logistic Regression) that simplifies the complex process of planning cardiac surgery, enhancing efficiency and ensuring optimal preparation for each procedure. By facilitating proactive care and optimized surgery planning, this project aims to significantly improve patient outcomes and enhance their quality of life. It empowers cardiac professionals, facilitates patient engagement, and enhances clinical efficiency. Our project provides solution to address escalating cardiovascular challenges, improving patient outcomes and elevating the standard of care and preventive measures

## How are we trying to solve?
Our solution,CardioVista,tackles this challenge by employing SVM and logistic regression models to predict cardiac disease likelihood. This optimized approach enhances accuracy in prognosis. On the front end, we prioritize user efficiency by incorporating alerts and presenting personalized wellness plans for at-risk patients. The preventive measures integrated into the system ensure a comprehensive approach to cardiac health, making our solution both predictive and proactive for improved patient outcomes.
